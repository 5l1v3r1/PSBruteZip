PSBruteZip allows you to brute force your way into Zip files should you have forgotten the password. 

How To Run:

Either locally using the script or remotely using: 

powershell –nop –c “iex(New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString(‘https://raw.githubusercontent.com/securethelogs/PSBruteZip/master/PSBruteZip.ps1’)”



Pre-Reqs:

1. 7Zip Installed
2. To have a zip file and know the location
3. To have a wordlist and know the location

Once it has these details, it will run through and crack the password, as so:
